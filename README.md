# Bonjour, mon ami! <img src="./assets/wave.gif" width="35px">

Hi, I am **Farhan Hasin Chowdhury**, a software developer from **Bangladesh** with a knack for learning new things and writing about them. I make open-source software and write free full-length handbooks to help out developers in their journey.

Apart from the handbooks on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/farhanhasin/), I write articles on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/fhsinchy/) every once in a while. These handbooks and articles are part of my mission to simplify hard to understand technologies for everyone. Each of these handbooks takes a lot of time and effort to write. Hence if you like my work, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/farhanhasin) as a token of appreciation.
