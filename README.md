# Bonjour, mon ami! <img src="./assets/wave.gif" width="35px">

Hi, I am Farhan Hasin Chowdhury. A young web/software developer from Bangladesh specializing in back-end programming. I have hands-on experience in languages like PHP, JavaScript and Go. I'm also confident in dev-ops related tools such as Docker, Kubernetes and Podman. In terms of database management systems, I have experience working with MySQL and MongoDB at medium to almost large scale.

I'm a huge supporter of the open-source mindset and try to contribute to the community as much as I can. Some of my popular open-source project are on display below and you may have read one or two of my handbooks.

Apart from the articles I write on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/fhsinchy/), I publish full-length handbooks on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/farhanhasin/) every once in a while. These handbooks and articles are part of my mission to simplify hard to understand technologies for everyone. Each of these handbooks takes a lot of time and effort to write. Hence if you like my work, [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/farhanhasin) as a token of appreciation.
