# Bonjour, mon ami! <img src="./assets/wave.gif" width="35px">

Hi, I am **Farhan Hasin Chowdhury**, a web/software developer and author from **Bangladesh**. I make open-source software and write free full-length handbooks to help out developers in their journey.

I'm a huge fan of the open-source mindset and try to contribute to the community as much as I can. Some of my popular open-source projects are on display below and you may have read one or two of my [handbooks](https://blog.farhan.dev/handbooks).

Apart from the articles I write on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/fhsinchy/), I publish full-length handbooks on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/farhanhasin/) every once in a while. These handbooks and articles are part of my mission to simplify hard to understand technologies for everyone. Each of these handbooks takes a lot of time and effort to write. Hence if you like my work, [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/farhanhasin) as a token of appreciation.
