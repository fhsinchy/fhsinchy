# Bonjour, mon ami! <img src="./assets/wave.gif" width="35px">

I am Farhan Hasin Chowdhury from Bangladesh. Apart from being a web/software developer, I am a voracious reader, a writer and video game enthusiast. I write on my [blog](https://blog.farhan.dev/) as well as [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/farhanhasin/). If you're fan of detective novels or love sneaking around in stealth video games or enjoy reading some quality content, we can be friends and if you're someone who likes my work, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fhsinchy) â˜•
