# Bonjour, mon ami! <img src="./assets/wave.gif" width="35px">

I am Farhan Hasin Chowdhury from Bangladesh. Apart from being a software developer, I am a voracious reader, a writer and video game enthusiast. I write on my [blog](https://farhan.info/) as well as [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/farhanhasin/). If you're fan of detective novels or love sneaking around in stealth video games or enjoy reading some quality content, we can be friends.
